      <p>
        You shudder awake, some horrible dream fast fading from your mind.
        You lie on the shores of a small, acred oasis.
        The sun hangs low in the sky. Leering from behind a rock formation of unusually serpentine suggestion.  
        Its fumes catch in your throat and eys.
        Across from you stands the crumbled remains of a massive city gate.
      </p>
    </div>
